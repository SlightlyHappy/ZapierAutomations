Useful changes: 
Can change prompt to look into different topics (target?keywords) and combine write up to generate ideas. This could be useful for AutoTikTok videos multiple generation pathway (tho overkill?). 
Can change code to look for different information (meta data) for target html (but borderline illegal without API access) then use data for some question-focused research? 

Needed to use: 
Zapier account - expensive but worth it (unless you'd like to figure out each step as a script (and probably save each step differently so the puzzle remains))
